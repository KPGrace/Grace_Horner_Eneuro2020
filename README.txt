The included computer code is in four parts. First, is a MATLAB script entitled ‘flip_flop_circuit_simulation_initializer.m’. This code was used to initialize simulations run with SimLIFnet (available for download at: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/50339 (Copyright © 2015, Zachary Danziger, All rights reserved)). Second is a MATLAB function entitled ‘forceramp.m’, which is required by ‘flip_flop_circuit_simulation_initializer.m’. Third, is a MATLAB script enitled ‘ intersection_finder.m’, which was used to identifying all points in state-space that bound trajectory intersections occurring within one minute-wide windows. Fourth, is a MATLAB script entitled ‘drug_diffusion_simulations.m’, which was used to estimate the 3-dimenional spread of drug from a point source in a microinjection versus a reverse-microdialysis scenario.
